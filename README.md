 # La Escuelita 
 
 La Escuelita is the first Spanish dual language preschool on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, and one of the first in NYC, La Escuelita has the experience and knowledge to fulfill its mission: the support of bilingualism in children from birth to 3rd grade. Our belief is that once you’ve read our website and visited the school, you’ll wholeheartedly agree.
